==============================================
A program in do must be ordered as follows:

configure statements

field declarations

global variable declarations

procedures

==============================================
A configure statement looks like this:

configure players: 2

You don't need to worry about type.

==============================================
A field declaration looks like this:

Player has Set called table

The type being extended comes first, then the
type of the new field, then the id for the
field.

==============================================
A variable is declared as follows:

new Number n : 42

But assigned like this:

n : 1

==============================================
A procedure is declared like this:

foo with Number a and Boolean b

==============================================
A procedure is called as follows:

do foo with a
do foo with a and b

The "with" is always necessary.
